# Flappy Duck, Project Milestone

This is Flappy Duck. A broswer videogame for all to enjoy.

I was drawn to make a game like flappy bird because it has simple concepts and I feel it is well within my reach.

## Criteria
The player must be able to make their PC jump with a click function
The player must be able to see their progress while they play, (how many obstacles did you dodge that game? and what is your high score)

## How we make it work
First must create a playable character who falls south of the screen unless you click to jump.
Also need to create an event or if then statements to rule the game OVER if the character hits any obstacles.
 Start button is also gonna be useful! 
CSS is also going to be implemented so my game can look somewhat presentable for the near future.
